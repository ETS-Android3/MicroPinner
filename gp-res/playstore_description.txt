This application allows you basically to create your own notifications.

<b>The application itself</b>
+ consumes no memory in the background - background-services, no background-processes
+ has no impact on your battery - it uses only native functions of Android
+ is compatible down to Android Jelly Bean
+ weights less than 700kb (Version v1.8)
+ is fully open source!

<b>Design & UI</b>
MicroPinner follows the official [Material Design](https://www.google.com/design/spec/components/dialogs.html#dialogs-specs) specs for dialogs.

<b>Customization</b>
You can customize the notifications title and content text as well as its system wide priority (choose between *normal*, *minimal*, *low* and *high*) and visibility (choose between *public*, *private* and *secret*) if you're running Android Lollipop and up.
Created pins are restored on reboot. Delete them by simply swiping it away.
