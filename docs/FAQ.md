<h6>Q: How does visibility affect a pin?</h6>
A: It mainly affects the pin's position on your lockscreen. *Normal* displays the pin like a normal notification, *private* hides the content-text and *secret* hides the whole pin.

<h6>Q: Help, visibility seems not working!</h6>
A: Maybe because you are using a Android version below 5.0 (Lollipop), where the visibility-feature doesn't work since it has been introduced with Lollipop.

<h6>Q: How does priority affect a pin?</h6>
A: Mainly the position in your notification-center. *High* places your pin above every other notification, *low* below every other notification and *min* below a small divider, completely at the bottom of your notification-center.

<h6>Q: Help, priority seems broken!</h6>
A: If you got a lot other *high*-priority notifications and you add another pin with priority *high*, Android will choose its position.
