###### Q: How does visibility affect a pin?
A: It mainly affecs the pin's position on your lockscreen. *Normal* displays the pin like a normal notification, *private* hides the content-text and *secret* hides the whole pin.

###### Q: Help, visibility seems not working!
A: Maybe because you are using a Android version below 5.0, where the visibility-feature doesn't work since it has been introduced with Lollipop.

###### Q: Could you sync my pins and/or save/export them?
A: I don't want to add more permissions such as network or internet-access. If I find a way to sync it for example with Google Keep, I'll add this as feature.

###### Q: How does priority affect a pin?
A: Mainly the position in your notification-center. *High* places your pin above every other notification, *low* below every other notification and *min* below a small divider, completely at the bottom of your notification-center.

###### Q: Help, priority seems broken!
A: If you got for example a lot other *high*-priority notifications and you add a pin with priority *high*, Android will choose its position.

###### Q: Where's the source-code?
A: You can find the whole code there: https://github.com/dotWee/MicroPinner
